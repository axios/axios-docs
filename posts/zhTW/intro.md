# What is Axios?
Axios is a *[promise-based](https://javascript.info/promise-basics)* HTTP Client for [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org) and the browser. It is *[isomorphic](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/what-is-an-isomorphic-application)* (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase). On the server-side it uses the native node.js `http` module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.

# Features

- Make [XMLHttpRequests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) from the browser
- Make [http](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html) requests from node.js
- Supports the [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) API
- Intercept request and response
- Transform request and response data
- Cancel requests
- Automatic transforms for JSON data
- Client side support for protecting against [XSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)
